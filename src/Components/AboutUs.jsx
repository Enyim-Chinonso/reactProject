            I am a hardworking, dedicated, fanatical, professional and dynamic Software Engineer with expertise in effective communication, teamwork and collaborations. I build, design and maintain scalable websites and web applications using HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT and REACT. I work with a team of highly talented and experienced developers and engineers to deliver solutions that solve our clients', users' and humanity's problems.  <br /> <br />
            
            I also contribute to the codebase, documentation, testing and deployment of our projects.
            My major goal is to continue learning and improving my skills and to explore new and innovative ways of using technology to solve the numerous real-world problems. <br /> <br />        
         
          
            I'm currently learning and building my skills through projects and challenges,
            always looking to grow and contribute to meaningful works. I'm also interested
            in remote internships, jobs and collaborative opportunities where I can keep building and improving.
